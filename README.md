# struo
A utility for switching and testing nixos configurations

The name comes from the Latin verb meaning "compose", "join together", or
"build".

The project is still early in development, and not considered suitable for use
at this stage.

# Goals/Planned Features:
- Configuration managed by NixOS module
- Strict generation management
- Lots of other stuff that I don't know how to describe currently
